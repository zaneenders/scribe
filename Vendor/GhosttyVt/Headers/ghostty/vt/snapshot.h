/** @defgroup snapshot Terminal Snapshot
 *
 * Encode and restore the complete state of a terminal via a binary format.
 *
 * A snapshot is an ordered, CRC-protected record stream. Its READY marker
 * follows enough state to render and resume the terminal, including any
 * unfinished VT parser input. Older scrollback pages follow READY and the
 * FINISH marker terminates the complete snapshot.
 *
 * End-of-file before an operation's required READY or FINISH marker is
 * malformed, truncated snapshot data and returns GHOSTTY_INVALID_VALUE.
 * GHOSTTY_IO_ERROR is reserved for a reader callback that returns false.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * The complete working example is available in `example/c-vt-snapshot`.
 *
 * ### Encode a terminal and its unfinished VT continuation
 * @snippet c-vt-snapshot/src/main.c snapshot-encode
 *
 * ### Restore a complete snapshot in one call
 * @snippet c-vt-snapshot/src/main.c snapshot-decode
 *
 * ### Adapt a byte source to GhosttyReader
 * @snippet c-vt-snapshot/src/main.c snapshot-buffer-reader
 *
 * ### Restore READY first, then incrementally prepend history
 * @snippet c-vt-snapshot/src/main.c snapshot-incremental
 *
 * ## Format
 *
 * Every integer is unsigned and little-endian. The stream begins with this
 * fixed ten-byte envelope:
 *
 * @code{.unparsed}
 * byte  0               8       10
 *       +---------------+--------+
 *       | "GHOSTSNP"    | version|
 *       | 8-byte magic  | u16    |
 *       +---------------+--------+
 * @endcode
 *
 * The envelope is followed by independently checksummed records. A record's
 * CRC32C covers its encoded tag and payload length followed by its payload; it
 * does not cover the CRC field itself.
 *
 * @code{.unparsed}
 * byte  0       2             6          10             10 + payload_len
 *       +-------+-------------+-----------+----------------+
 *       | tag   | payload_len | CRC32C    | payload        |
 *       | u16   | u32         | u32       | payload_len B  |
 *       +-------+-------------+-----------+----------------+
 *       \____________________/             \______________/
 *          CRC prefix                         CRC suffix
 * @endcode
 *
 * Record groups occur in this strict order. SCREEN and HISTORY groups contain
 * one entry for each screen declared by TERMINAL. Each manifest is followed
 * by the number of PAGE records it declares. Active SCREEN pages make the
 * terminal renderable; HISTORY pages are older scrollback ordered newest to
 * oldest so an incremental decoder can prepend them as they arrive.
 *
 * @code{.unparsed}
 * +---------------- TERMINAL ----------------+
 * | terminal-wide state and screen count     |
 * +----------------- SCREEN -----------------+  repeated per screen
 * | active-screen manifest                   |
 * +------------------ PAGE ------------------+  repeated per manifest
 * | active screen rows                       |
 * +------------- CONTINUATION ---------------+
 * | unfinished VT/UTF-8 input, or ground     |
 * +------------------ READY -----------------+
 * | empty renderable-state marker            |  ready() returns here
 * +----------------- HISTORY ----------------+  repeated per screen
 * | scrollback manifest                      |
 * +------------------ PAGE ------------------+  next() consumes one page
 * | older screen rows                        |
 * +------------------ FINISH ----------------+
 * | empty end-of-snapshot marker              |  next() returns NO_VALUE
 * +------------------------------------------+
 * | trailing transport bytes (not consumed) |
 * +------------------------------------------+
 * @endcode
 *
 * READY separates the renderable prefix through CONTINUATION from history.
 * FINISH terminates the record sequence. Both are empty records protected by
 * CRC32C, like every other record. Declared record counts, tags, and strict
 * decoding enforce the stream's ordering and completeness.
 *
 * Snapshot format version 1 is a work in progress and does not yet carry a
 * binary-compatibility guarantee.
 *
